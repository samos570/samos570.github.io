I'm a mathematician who has decided to leave college teaching to explore the
rapidly growing field of deep learning. In these pages I'm going to try to
explain all sorts of mathematical topics needed to understand these important
ideas, often as I learn about them myself.  Articles will range from the very
basic to the very complex and so my hope is that everyone will be able to find
a place to get started.
